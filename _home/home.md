I am a grad student at University of Washington – Foster School of Business, Seattle currently pursuing Masters in Supply Chain Management. Having nine years of work experience through working in Fortune 500 companies across the manufacturing, fast moving consumer goods, and pharmaceutical industries, I have actively contributed to various facets of supply chain management. I have developed expertise through practical involvement in pivotal roles, including demand-supply planning, production and purchase planning, capacity planning, and inventory management.

<br>
I have spearheaded operational excellence initiatives and continuous improvement projects, resulting in substantial cost savings of $3.5 million through effective collaboration with stakeholders from various geographical locations and cultural backgrounds. I was honoured with the Novo Nordisk Way Spirit Award for improving processes and ensuring the stability of aseptic production operations at the China plant, along with the establishment and maintenance of positive relationships with stakeholders. I received my Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering from Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology, Surat , India.

<br>
I am eager to transition into Program Manager, Product Manager, or Project Manager and Supply Chain Manager roles in the Technology, Retail, and Consulting industries post-graduation.
